This repository is based on a Course: Programaci√≥n Reactiva con Spring Boot y Spring WebFlux

## About the course
In this project, I'm creating a comprehensive system connected to a MongoDB NoSQL database. I'm trying to implement a complete set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with table relationships using the Spring Data Mongo API. Additionally, I tackled challenging aspects such as file uploading, error handling, and form validation.

The project heavily emphasizes functional programming and the implementation of reactive RESTful APIs. I'm utilizing Functional Endpoints (Router Functions) and leveraged the flexibility of Thymeleaf reactive to create highly interactive user interfaces.

The project's quality is reinforced by the inclusion of thorough unit testing using JUnit and WebTestClient. I'm also integrating the WebClient HTTP client for efficient consumption of RESTful services.

Furthermore, I'm exploring microservices architecture using Spring Cloud Eureka. I'm creating and registered microservices, enabling effective and scalable communication between them.

The "Reactive Programming with Spring Boot 3, Spring WebFlux, and Project Reactor" project offers a complete and detailed learning experience, providing the necessary skills to develop high-quality reactive applications. I am proud to present this project, which covers a wide range of topics and offers a practical approach to reactive application development with Spring Boot and its associated tools.
